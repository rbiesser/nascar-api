It netted him an 11th-place finish, falling just shy of a top-10 result after a late-race mixing of fenders with seven-time champ and Martinsville master Jimmie Johnson.</p><p>&#8220;Man, our car was so good,&#8221; Wallace told FOX Sports after the Blue-Emu Maximum Pain Relief 500. &#8220;Our Black Lives Matter Chevrolet &#8212; that&#8217;s good to say right there &#8212; was so good on the long run. &#8230; But all in all, great job to come here and execute, no practice. My favorite place, and it just continues to show. I&#8217;ll tell you what was badass, racing with seven-time there at the end, Jimmie Johnson. You think, Jimmie Johnson wins so many times here and we&#8217;re running him down. That&#8217;s hat&#8217;s off to my guys, so good job, fellas.&#8221;</p><p>Wallace finished among the top 10 at each stage break, his team battling through a mechanical issue that required extra pumps of the jack during pit stops. His affinity for the .526-mile track helped to offset that, aiding his cause at the site of two wins for him in the Gander RV &amp; Outdoors Truck Series.</p><p>Though he slipped toward the end of the lead-lap cars during the final stage, he rallied down the stretch to vie for his third top 10 of the season.</p><p>But Wednesday&#8217;s result carried much more meaning than his outcome on the scoring sheet. For the second straight race, he wore a T-shirt with messages of &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Breathe&#8221; and &#8220;Black Lives Matter&#8221; in the wake of protests surrounding the death of George Floyd on May 25 in Minnesota. His statement, lifted by support from his fellow drivers and the sanctioning body, helped Wallace lead the call for the confederate flag to be banned from NASCAR tracks and grounds in a Monday night interview with CNN.</p><p><strong>RELATED:<a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/06/10/nascar-statement-on-confederate-flag/\"> NASCAR Statement on confederate flag</a></strong></p><p>Less than 48 hours later and just hours before Wednesday&#8217;s start at Martinsville, NASCAR issued a condemnation of the flag and its prohibition from those settings. Wallace drove home what the event meant to him in a pre-race message to his crew.</p><p>&#8220;Like that message I sent you guys, biggest night of my life right here,&#8221; Wallace said over the No. 43 radio. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give it my all. &#8230; Everybody watching, new faces watching. Appreciate y&#8217;all&#8217;s support. Support this week&#8217;s been pretty unreal, so definitely didn&#8217;t go unnoticed.&#8221;</p><p>New faces seemed to take notice, too. NASCAR&#8217;s decision, Wallace&#8217;s paint scheme and the sport&#8217;s substantial steps toward real change drew new fans to social media and garnered support from famous names in other walks of life &#8212; notably NBA star LeBron James, soccer pro Jozy Altidore, actress Reese Witherspoon and Bernice King, Martin Luther King&#8217;s youngest child.</p><p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s great, the initiative he&#8217;s showing and wanting to be a part of change, the right change,&#8221; said Ryan Blaney, a close friend to Wallace and Wednesday&#8217;s runner-up. &#8220;I feel like he&#8217;s on his way, man. He&#8217;s doing a really good job. I think he was on CNN the other night, he did a great job on that. Like I said, I&#8217;ve just known him a long time and he&#8217;s just Bubba to me. I think of him as a brother. It&#8217;s good to talk to him, but I think he&#8217;s definitely not getting sleep because he&#8217;s so busy. It&#8217;s good things, a good cause that he&#8217;s striving toward.&#8221;</p>]]>",

Meanwhile, there were two cars with one lug nut not safe and secure in post-race inspection, the No. 9 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet of Chase Elliott and the No. 18 JGR Toyota of Kyle Busch. Those safety infractions usually mean a $10,000 fine for the crew chief, according to guidelines in the NASCAR Rule Book.</p><p>This is the second year of a post-race process to bring a more timely approach to inspection for all three NASCAR national series. Competition officials announced before the 2019 season that thorough post-race inspections would take place shortly after the checkered flag at the track instead of midweek at the NASCAR Research &amp; Development Center. Those inspections come with a stiffer deterrence structure that includes disqualification for significant rules infractions.</p><p>NASCAR will still inspect cars at the R&amp;D Center as needed to monitor trends and parts compliance.</p>]]>",

The changes include significantly smaller spoilers, splitters and other aerodynamic devices in an effort to place a greater emphasis on handling and driver input with less stabilizing downforce on those tracks. The package draws inspiration from similar rules used in the 2017-18 seasons.</p><p>Among the changes for those specific tracks:</p><ul><li>A significantly smaller rear spoiler, which shrinks from an 8-inch height to 2.75 inches.</li><li>The front splitter&#8216;s overhang will now measure a quarter-inch (down from 2 inches), with approximately 2-inch wings (reduced from 10.5 inches).</li><li>Alterations to the radiator pan, removing its vertical fencing in an effort to reduce front-end downforce. The dimensions of the pan remain the same.</li></ul><p><strong>GOODYEAR TIRES</strong></p><p><b>Unique set of challenges: </b>Wednesday&#8216;s stop at the half-mile Martinsville Speedway presents one similar challenge and one that is quite different, compared to the series&#8217; first short-track race of the year at Bristol Motor Speedway. Similar to Bristol, Martinsville&#8216;s corners are concrete, and the tread compounds Goodyear chooses to bring are specifically designed to lay rubber on that surface. The difference is the banking as Martinsville is virtually flat while Bristol is steeply banked. As a result, the constructions of these two tire codes have been designed to optimize the acceleration, deceleration and handling needed on Martinsville&#8216;s flat, tight turns. Also of note, since this is the first night race at Martinsville, the Goodyear test at this track last summer that yielded this tire setup was held partially under the track&#8216;s new lights.</p><p>&#8220;Moving the first Martinsville race later in the schedule will have an impact on tires and the track&#8216;s ability to take rubber,&#8221; said Greg Stucker, Goodyear&#8216;s director of racing. &#8220;Originally scheduled for May and now being held in June, ambient temperatures will be warmer, which will help the cars&#8216; ability to lay rubber in the concrete corners. Even though this race will be held at night, track temperatures should be warmer than what we ‘normally&#8216; have for this event. In addition to the concrete corners, Martinsville&#8216;s lack of banking, long straightaways and tight turns combine for the other challenge teams face. Drivers are hard on the brakes entering the corners and hard on the gas exiting, so our constructions have to be very robust in handling those conditions.&#8221;</p><p><b>Goodyear debuts new tire setup: </b>There are two new tire codes NASCAR Cup teams will run at Martinsville Speedway. Compared to what was run at this track last season, this tire setup features construction updates on both sides of the car and compound changes on both sides that will give the cars more grip and introduce more tire wear. This tire setup came out of a test at Martinsville last July. Drivers, and teams who participated in that test were Team Penske (Ryan Blaney), Stewart-Haas Racing (Clint Bowyer) and Wood Brothers Racing (Paul Menard). This is the only track where NASCAR teams will run either of these two tire codes. Also, like most NASCAR ovals one mile or less in length, teams will not run inner liners in their tires at Martinsville.</p><p><strong>STATS TO KNOW</strong></p><p>&#8212; Both Martinsville Speedway winners in 2019 swept all three stages. Brad Keselowski won both stages and the race in the spring and Martin Truex Jr. won both stages and the race in the fall.</p><p>&#8212; Team Penske (three) and Joe Gibbs Racing (two) won five of the last six at Martinsville Speedway.</p><p>&#8212; Ford drivers have won four of the last six races at Martinsville Speedway after the manufacturer failed to win any of the prior 28 races. Brad Keselowski won two of the last six Martinsville races and is the only repeat winner in the last seven races there. Chevrolet has 56 Martinsville wins but has won only once in the last eight races.</p><p>&#8212; The last five Martinsville Speedway races were won by the driver who led the most laps, while the last five winners led a stretch of over 100 laps in each of their victories. Two of the last five races ended with a last-lap pass; the final lead change in the other three races was with 114 laps to go or more.</p><p>&#8212; Only once in the last seven Martinsville Speedway races has a driver earned their first win of the season. Clint Bowyer accomplished the feat in the spring 2018 race.</p><p>&#8212; The past five races at Martinsville Speedway have produced five different winners &#8212; Kyle Busch (fall 2017), Clint Bowyer (spring 2018), Joey Logano (fall 2018), Brad Keselowski (spring 2019) and Martin Truex Jr. (fall 2019).</p><p><em>Source: NASCAR statistics, Racing Insights</em><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>LIVE COVERAGE</strong></p><p>Tune in Wednesday night at 7 p.m. ET to television coverage from Martinsville Speedway on FS1 and the FOX Sports App. For full radio coverage, listen in to MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio on-air.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/followlive\">Ways to follow the races</a></strong></p><p>For a more interactive experience, head over to NASCAR.com or the NASCAR app to check out an enhanced Race Center, live Lap-by-Lap coverage, the customizable live leaderboard with Scanner (which is FREE for both races), and the return of <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/drive\">Drive</a> (featuring in-car cameras).</p><p>Be sure to set your lineup in <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/fantasy\">Fantasy Live</a> and make your picks in the <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/finishline\">NASCAR Finish Line App.</a></p><p><strong>2019 RACE WINNER</strong></p><p>Brad Keselowski, who has already won two races in 2020, took his No. 2 Team Penske Ford to Victory Lane in last season&#8216;s first of two trips to Martinsville Speedway.

Whenever someone asks for my perfect hypothetical Cup Series schedule, my reply is, &#8220;36 races at Martinsville.&#8221; Martinsville is old school in every way: short, flat, tight and bumpers are not only encouraged, they&#8217;re required to make passes.</p><p>Wednesday&#8217;s Blue-Emu Maximum Pain Relief 500 (7 p.m. ET, FS1) will also be the first Cup Series night race at Martinsville, so expect plenty of bumping and banging under the lights.</p><p>In order to zero in on my best for Martinsville, I&#8217;m leaning heavily on results from 2018, which were run with a race package similar to what teams will use.</p><p>Be sure to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PJWalsh24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">follow me on Twitter (@PJWalsh24</a>) for any additional bets I add for Martinsville.</p><h2><strong>NASCAR at Martinsville Odds, Betting Picks</strong></h2><p><em>*Odds as of Wednesday at 7 a.m. ET</em></p><h3><strong>Kyle Busch (+460) to win at Martinsville</strong></h3><p>When it comes to Martinsville, Kyle Busch is the first name that comes to mind. Over his last nine races at the track known as &#8220;The Paperclip,&#8221; Busch has two wins and eight top-five finishes.</p><p>More specifically, Busch also had the best car at Martinsville in 2018.</p><p>In those two races, Busch had the best average finish, ran the most fast laps, had the best average running position and the best driver rating.</p><p>And the icing on the cake? Busch finished second at Atlanta Motor Speedway last Sunday, meaning his team will have the second pick when selecting its pit stall. Considering the importance of track position and Martinsville&#8217;s tight pit road, this could be the difference between winning and losing.</p><h3><strong>Denny Hamlin (+700) to win at Martinsville</strong></h3><p>I&#8217;m having a hard time separating Hamlin and Brad Keselowski. If two options are viewed equally, it makes sense to simply take the one with the best odds/potential payout. In this case, that option is Hamlin.</p><p>In 2018 at Martinsville, Hamlin had the second-best average running position, ran the second-most fast laps and led the fourth-most laps.</p><p>And while this is certainly more subjective than the numbers above, Goodyear is bringing a softer tire to Martinsville with the goal being more wear and falloff later in green-flag runs.</p><p>A high-horsepower, low-downforce race with excessive tire wear is right in Hamlin&#8217;s wheelhouse at Martinsville, making him a very attractive option at 7-1.</p><h3><strong>Clint Bowyer (+2000) to win at Martinsville</strong></h3><p>Since joining Stewart-Haas Racing prior to the start of the 2017 season, Bowyer has one win and four top-seven finishes in six races at Martinsville.</p><p>And more importantly, that win came in the spring of 2018. In fact, Bowyer had the third-best driver rating over both Martinsville races that season.</p><p>Bowyer also finished fifth at Phoenix Raceway earlier this year, another flat track that used the same package teams will race at Martinsville.</p>]]>",

					"Body Top": "<![CDATA[<p>Just like it did with essential personnel this past month, NASCAR will require guests attending the upcoming NASCAR Cup Series races at Homestead-Miami Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway to follow strict at-track safety precautions as the world continues to battle the COVID-19 outbreak.</p><p>Guests have not been allowed into any national series events since the coronavirus forced a pause on all three schedules back in March. The sanctioning body announced Tuesday a limited number of guests will be permitted to attend the Dixie Vodka 400 on Sunday in Florida and the GEICO 500 on June 21 in Alabama. All guests will be screened before entering, required to wear face masks, mandated to social distance and are forbidden from the infield, among other new safety protocols.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/06/09/nascar-implements-plan-to-welcome-back-guests-at-select-tracks/\">NASCAR reveals plan to welcome back guests</a></strong></p><p>&#8220;The race-day experience will be different, it&#8217;s just different times, and fans will have to adjust that,&#8221; said Daryl Wolfe, NASCAR&#8217;s Executive Vice President, Chief Operations and Sales Officer. &#8220;We will have to adjust on how we&#8217;re addressing these issues for fans. We think we have a very, very good plan in place &#8212; a very detailed plan &#8212; but make no mistake, I&#8217;m sure there will be some key learnings coming out of Homestead that then we will reapply and adjust for Talladaga.&#8221;</p><p>That&#8217;s how NASCAR has gone about every race since the sport returned to action on May 17 at Darlington Raceway &#8212; adjusting where needed, when needed with a scrutinous eye on safety. There have been six Cup Series events since then. None of them had practice. Only one had qualifying. A <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/06/04/nascar-announces-next-installment-in-return-to-racing-schedule/\">revised 2020 schedule</a> has been planned out through Aug. 2, featuring midweek shows and weekend doubleheaders.</p><p>Homestead will invite up to 1,000 South Florida service members. The 1.5-mile track&#8217;s grandstand has 55,000 seats.</p><p>Talladega will welcome 5,000 fans. NASCAR&#8217;s longest oval at 2.66 miles can hold about 80,000 people in its main grandstand alone.</p><p class=\"p1\">&#8220;It is so dependent on the local communities, advice from medical experts, working directly with governor&#8217;s offices,&#8221; Wolfe said. &#8220;Candidly, frankly, in some states there is more flexibility than in other states. ​Having said that, we can probably be more aggressive with some of these numbers, but we&#8217;re choosing not to. We want to start very small, learn and then adapt.&#8221;</p><p>Concessions will be open since outside coolers will not be allowed for safety reasons. Face masks will be available to guests who do not bring their own. Hand sanitizing and washing will be encouraged with stations easily accessible. There will be a cleaning team visibly working throughout the event in public areas.</p><p class=\"p1\">Modified event procedures, specifically when it comes to health safety, have been finalized with guidance from multiple credible sources &#8212; inside and outside the industry.</p><p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve been doing is we&#8217;ve reached out and have an infectious disease physician and epidemiologist. We&#8217;ve actually talked to several of those,&#8221; NASCAR Vice President of Racing Operations John Bobo said. &#8220;​What we find is we also need our physicians that we&#8217;ve worked with for years through our consulting group that understand racing.  We can get the best advice from infectious disease specialists, but also talk to physicians who are actively treating COVID patients and apply it to racing.</p><p>&#8220;​A lot of sets of eyeballs, a lot of people weighing in. We try to be thoughtful, listen, put that all together. &#8221;</p><p>NASCAR officials have not determined whether guests will be allowed beyond the Talladega event. Wolfe said he knows it has been announced that Pocono Raceway, which is next on the schedule after Talladega, will not have outside attendees, but that the issue will be addressed further when the time comes.</p><p>Wolfe and Bobo both acknowledged how important it is to get this next step in NASCAR&#8217;s return-to-racing plan right. They also know fans are probably the most important step back toward normalcy.</p><p>&#8220;Oh, I miss them a lot,&#8221; Joe Gibbs Racing driver Denny Hamlin said before the return announcement. &#8220;To me, I miss the pre-race stuff as much as anything. &#8230; Going out to driver intros, fans are either rooting you on or cussing you out. I mean, I&#8217;ll take a few cuss-outs here now. I don&#8217;t even care. I just want to hear something.&#8221;</p>]]>",

NASCAR will continue to adapt and improve its procedures to ensure they are effective and can be scaled to support an increased number of fans in the future.</p><p>“We have tremendous respect and appreciation for the responsibility that comes with integrating guests back into our events,” said Daryl Wolfe, Executive Vice President, Chief Operations and Sales Officer, NASCAR. “We believe implementing this methodical process is an important step forward for the sport and the future of live sporting events. The passion and unwavering support of our industry and fans is the reason we race each weekend and we look forward to slowly and responsibly welcoming them back at select events.”</p><p>NASCAR will continue its long history of honoring military members by welcoming them as the first guests allowed entrance to a NASCAR Cup Series event since March 8. Homestead-Miami Speedway will invite up to 1,000 South Florida service members as honorary guests for the Dixie Vodka 400, representing the Homestead Air Reserve Base and U.S. Southern Command in Doral.</p><p>Talladega Superspeedway will allow up to 5,000 guests in the frontstretch grandstands/towers for the GEICO 500.

We&#8217;ve been knocking on the door, we&#8217;ve just been ‑ it just feels like it hasn&#8217;t been our season yet, but we&#8217;re right there.  The guys are doing a great job, and our cars are fast, and we just ‑ we&#8217;ve got to put it all together one of these days coming soon.&#8221;</p><p>Busch was hot on Truex&#8217;s tail, finishing second in Stage 1 and third in Stage 2 before earning a second-place result. Both Busch and Truex have yet to break into Victory Lane this season, while Hamlin has two victories to his credit so far this year &#8212; the Daytona 500 and the rain-shortened second race at Darlington Raceway.</p><p>But while it seems like Joe Gibbs Racing may be turning a corner that could leave the competition sweating in the coming weeks, Busch feels there is still more room for improvement if they want to reach their dominant ways again.</p><p>&#8220;Atlanta is kind of its own beast,&#8221; Busch said. &#8220;Well, Atlanta and Homestead are pretty significant high downforce tracks, and we tend to run well here. Truex definitely tends to run well here. He did last year, and I think Denny has won here a couple times, so it&#8217;s a place that we should have good results at, and it&#8217;s nice to come out of here with a good solid run, run up front all day long and have a good outing. Hopefully, we can keep that momentum rolling.&#8221;</p><p>Erik Jones appeared to have the car to compete for a top-10 finish when a tire issue forced him to bring the No. 20 Toyota down pit road unscheduled stop in the final stage.</p><p>The series heads to Martinsville Speedway for a Wednesday night showdown under the lights for the first time at the .526-mile short track (7 p.m. ET on FS1, MRN, SiriusXM NASCAR Radio), where the four drivers have a combined eight victories, led by Virginia native Hamlin with five triumphs.</p>]]>",

Busch passed Truex for second with five laps to go.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/results/racecenter/2020/nascar-cup-series/folds-of-honor-quiktrip-500/stn/results/\">Official race results</a>| <a href=\"https://store.nascar.com/kevin-harvick/t-47133021+z-9568190-3511458044?ab={wt-static_graphic}{pt-home}{al-teamlinks}{ct-Kevin_Harvick}\">SHOP for Harvick gear</a><br /></strong></p><p>It was Harvick&#8216;s second victory of the season (he also won at Darlington Raceway in NASCAR&#8216;s first race back since the sport was sidelined during the COVID-19 pandemic) and it is the 44-year-old Californian&#8216;s ninth top-10 finish in 10 races this year. With it, Harvick extends his NASCAR Cup Series championship lead to 48 points over Team Penske&#8216;s Joey Logano.</p><p>Logano&#8216;s teammate Ryan Blaney and JGR driver Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five at Atlanta, followed by Kurt Busch, Jimmie Johnson, Chase Elliott and Team Penske teammates Brad Keselowski and Logano. For Kurt Busch, making top 10 was an especially impressive effort considering he started last in the field because of pre-race inspection violations.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/06/07/pre-race-inspection-cup-series-atlanta-motor-speedway/\">Why Kurt Busch started from the rear</a></strong></p><p>Clint Bowyer led 58 laps only to pit late in the race and fall out of a top-10 finish. He ended up 20th.</p><p>Harvick&#8216;s Ford was considered the car to beat at Atlanta even before the seven-time champ Johnson gave the command to start engines Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Harvick earned an emotional first career NASCAR Cup Series win at Atlanta back in 2001, three weeks after taking over driving duties for the late seven-time champion Dale Earnhardt, who was killed in the Daytona 500 season-opener. Harvick held up three fingers in a reverse victory lap Sunday in honor of Earnhardt and the champ&#8216;s famed No. 3 car.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/video/franchise/goodyear-burnout/harvick-salutes-dale-earnhardt-after-atlanta-win/\">Watch Kevin Harvick salute Dale Earnhardt after the race</a></strong></p><p>“First (career) win came for me here at Atlanta and this is just a track that I&#8216;ve taken a liking to,” Harvick said. “You always have those memories and now you want to celebrate everything that Dale Earnhardt did for this sport. To come here and be able to do that with wins and go to Victory Lane is pretty special.</p><p>“We had a great pit stop, got to restart on the bottom and got my car to take off and I was able to get track position. Once I could get through those first 10 laps and my car was freed up enough, I could get in a rhythm and really hit my marks, then with about 25 laps I could just drive away.&#8221;</p><p>Harvick has been the driver of record as of late. He answered that first win 17 years later (in 2018) and is currently in the midst of an amazing nine-year run at the track. He&#8216;s led at least 100 laps in seven of the last nine races &#8212; and more than 10,000 laps out front since joining Stewart-Haas Racing in 2014.</p><p>Truex Jr.&#8216;s two stage wins were the 2017 Cup Series champion&#8216;s first of the season. And for much of the race, he was there ready to interrupt Harvick&#8216;s longtime dominance at the track. That opportunity never came.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/06/07/stage-recap-results-atlanta-motor-speedway/\">Martin Truex grabs his first stage wins of the season</a></strong></p><p>It would have been the first win of the season for Truex, who has been so-close at Atlanta &#8212; finishing second in 2019 and scoring top-10 finishes in the last six races.</p><p>Tyler Reddick, driver of the No. 8 Richard Childress Racing Chevrolet, was the top finishing Sunoco Rookie of the Year candidate &#8212; with a 16th-place finish.</p><p>Before the race NASCAR President Steve Phelps addressed the race field and the nation pledging that the sport is sensitive to the country&#8216;s current social unrest and committed to improving race relations.</p><p>“Our country is in pain and our people are justifiably angry, demanding to be heard,” Phelps said. “Our sport must do better.

Further commemorations were held during pre-race ceremonies, including a moment of silence.</p><p>The video message comes after several drivers spoke out last weekend in support of healing the nation&#8217;s racial divide. Bubba Wallace and Daniel Suarez were among the first to open up with their thoughts, and they were joined by Ty Dillon, Jimmie Johnson, Tyler Reddick, Ryan Blaney and others.</p><p>After finished seventh in Sunday&#8217;s race, Johnson explained that he took an active role in organizing the drivers&#8217; message.</p><p>&#8220;I was involved in helping put it together, and I was just really proud of the drivers who got involved,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;Honestly proud of NASCAR and what they did, but it&#8217;s been a personal journey on a much deeper level this week for me to listen and learn, and as a lot of us drivers started chatting about the week and experience and a lot of this was led by Bubba. Really have to give him a ton of credit, including Ty Dillon, the accountability that those two really put on the garage area, put on me ‑ not directly on me, but I could just see ‑ it made a difference, and I think that resonated with a lot of people.</p><p>&#8220;I spent a lot of time listening and learning this week, and that message rang clear with many of my other driver friends, and we kind of found that message, and that was the message that made it into the video.&#8221;</p><p>Wallace was seen on pit road during pre-race ceremonies wearing a T-shirt reading, &#8220;I can&#8217;t breathe&#8221; and &#8220;Black Lives Matter,&#8221; which his Richard Petty Motorsports No. 43 team held up on pit road. Wallace amplified his message in the FOX Sports pre-race broadcast, and analyst Jeff Gordon echoed his push for change.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We will listen and learn!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackLivesMattters?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BlackLivesMattters</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/AYoYdY8IlX\">pic.twitter.com/AYoYdY8IlX</a></p><p>&mdash; Bubba Wallace (@BubbaWallace) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BubbaWallace/status/1269693667796795394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2020</a></p></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/06/05/ty-dillon-using-platform-to-stand-against-racial-injustice-ill-stand-up-for-what-i-believe-in/\">Ty Dillon: &#8216;This is where I stand&#8217;</a></strong></p><p>The national anthem was performed by 12-year-old Keedron Bryant, whose song &#8220;I Just Want to Live&#8221; spread on social media in the wake of the social unrest.</p><p>The 40-car field stopped on the frontstretch during pace laps and silenced the engines for an address from NASCAR president Steve Phelps.</p><p>&#8220;Thank you for your time.

Our sport must do better. Our country must do better. The time is now to listen, to understand and to stand against racism and racial injustice. We ask our drivers &#8230; and all our fans to join us in this mission, to take a moment of reflection, to acknowledge that we must do better as a sport, and join us as we now pause and take a moment to listen.&#8221;</p><p>Race winner Kevin Harvick said he joined the video message in hopes of lending support and making a difference.</p><p>&#8220;For me, something just has to change, and I think when you look at what happened in Minnesota, it&#8217;s just disgraceful to everyone,&#8221; Harvick said of Floyd&#8217;s death. &#8220;To be able to have conversations about things, I&#8217;m definitely a person that wants to hear a plan that has actions included in it, and just try to support each other and do the things that we can do to try to help our communities and help the conversations because there&#8217;s so much that everyone doesn&#8217;t understand of what we need to do and how we need to do it.  But I can tell you that we need change.&#8221;</p><p>Wallace and Dillon openly discussed the issue in a nearly <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/06/02/bubba-wallace-ty-dillon-open-up-in-insightful-instagram-live-discussion/\">30-minute video chat</a> last week as Wallace relayed some of his experiences as the lone African-American driver in NASCAR&#8217;s top series.</p><p>Sunday, as the field made its final pace lap before the initial green flag, Wallace told his crew: &#8220;All right, boys. this last week&#8217;s been pretty damn stressful to say the least. Racing with a lot on my mind, a lot on my heart, so appreciate the efforts and see what we can do today.&#8221;</p>]]>",

NJ and IN only.]</a></mark></p><h3><strong>Alex Bowman (+1000)</strong></h3><p>If we ignore Bristol, which is so vastly different from Atlanta that NASCAR handicappers should be doing that anyway, Bowman has the best average running position, has led the most laps and has run the most fast laps in the other four races (two at Darlington and two at Charlotte) since the Cup Series returned last month.</p><p>In addition, Bowman smoked the field and won back in March at Auto Club Speedway, a racetrack with extreme tire wear just like Atlanta.</p><p><mark><a href=\"https://switchboard.actionnetwork.com/offers?bookId=68&amp;context=web-article-textlink-betnow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">[Bet now at DraftKings.

Just got beat by his experience. He&#8217;s a phenomenal driver and a great competitor in the series. It was a lot of fun racing with him. Just burnt my stuff up when I thought he burnt his stuff up, so I started making a charge there with about 15-20 to go. Burnt my tires up and he just drove away.&#8221;</p><p>The second-place finish for Gragson continues a strong run of momentum this season, which kicked off with a victory in the season-opening race at Daytona International Speedway, which is crucial for the driver&#8217;s future after shedding light that he doesn&#8217;t have 2021 racing plans at this moment.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fighting for a job right now,&#8221; Gragson said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t really know what I&#8217;m going to do next year. All I can do is focus on today. All I can do is focus on this race team and on myself to be better. It&#8217;s a cut-throat sport. &#8230; Definitely very grateful to be driving these race cars with such big-name logos on the hood. Right now, nothing&#8217;s given to you in this world, so you have to fight every single day, every minute to do the best job possible on and off the race track.</p><p>&#8220;At the end of the day, it&#8217;s me, I need to step up,&#8221; Gragson added. &#8220;I feel like I&#8217;m doing everything I can right now, just trying to stay focused, stay positive and do everything I can. I feel like if I can do the best job I can do on and off the race track, I can&#8217;t do any better.&#8221;</p><p>Winning the big money also earned Gragson a spot in the next Dash 4 Cash event at the second race of a doubleheader next weekend at Homestead-Miami Speedway (Sun., June 14 at noon ET on FS1). The other eligible drivers include winner Allmendinger, Justin Haley and Gragson&#8217;s teammate Daniel Hemric.</p><p>While Allmendinger does not run the full Xfinity Series schedule, Kaulig Racing team president Chris Rice noted that they plan to field a car for him in the second race, but they will not run the first race on June 13, meaning Allmendinger will be forced to start at the rear of the field in the battle for the Dash 4 Cash bonus next Sunday.</p>]]>",

Briscoe led 40 laps and Allgaier ran consistently in the top five &#8212; but both were penalized for speeding on pit road on a final stop with 39 laps remaining. They came out of the pits first (Briscoe) and second (Allgaier) before getting news of the penalty that dropped them back to 25th and 27th, respectively, for that restart.</p><p>Allmendinger had come out of the pits third, so he inherited the lead and never looked back.</p><p>&#8220;I just felt like we needed track position the whole time, so once we got that lead, it was about getting a good restart,&#8221; he said, adding, &#8220;Had to kind of pace myself the last 15 laps, beg for no yellows.&#8221;</p><p>A former IndyCar Series champion contender, Allmendinger was highly regarded for his road-course skills when he came to NASCAR. He earned his only NASCAR Cup Series victory in 2014 on the Watkins Glen road course and had three previous Xfinity Series wins &#8212; on road courses at Road America, the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course and the Charlotte ROVAL.</p><p>&#8220;I just wanted to win on an oval,&#8221; Allmendinger said. &#8220;There were definitely several opportunities in the Cup car to win on an oval, but it never worked out. I wanted to win on an oval that we really had to drive and get after it.&#8221;</p><p>Austin Cindric was also penalized for speeding on pit road in that final series of stops. The driver of the No. 22 Penske Racing Ford led a race-high 68 laps and looked like the car to beat early &#8212; winning both the opening stages. His car was so dominant in the early laps that he won the first stage by nearly nine seconds over Chastain. Cindric finished 16th.</p><p>Briscoe beat Cindric out of the pits during the second stage break, and the two Ford drivers kept one another honest with Chastain right there followed by the JR Motorsports cars driven by Hemric and Allgaier. Hemric&#8216;s fourth-place finish was his fifth top 10 in seven races he&#8216;s competed this year for JR Motorsports.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/06/06/noah-gragson-wins-atlanta-dash-4-cash-bonus-amid-uncertain-plans-for-2021/\">Noah Gragson wins Dash 4 Cash bonus amid uncertainty for 2021</a></strong></p><p>The Dash 4 Cash victory for last week&#8216;s Bristol winner Gragson was a feel-good ending for the 21-year-old who said he ultimately learned a lot racing Allmendinger.

After a final round of pit stops, Hill reassumed the lead for a two-lap sprint to the checkered flag, but it was Grant Enfinger&#8217;s No. 98 Ford that was able to push past Hill&#8217;s No. 16 Hattori Racing Toyota for the race win.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/results/racecenter/2020/nascar-gander-outdoors-truck-series/vet-tix-camping-world-200/stn/results/\">Race results</a></strong></p><p>Hill had to settle for second, holding off Kyle Busch Motorsports rookie Christian Eckes after leading 36 of the 136 total circuits.</p><p>&#8220;All in all, that white-flag lap going alongside the 98, I got on the splitter a little bit going into (Turn) 1,&#8221; Hill said during his post-race media availability. &#8220;Ultimately, it just got tight and when it did, he (Enfinger) was able to clear me off of (Turn) 2.

					"Body Top": "<![CDATA[<p>Grant Enfinger muscled the lead from Austin Hill on a two-lap overtime restart to claim the victory in Saturday afternoon&#8216;s Vet Tix Camping World 200 NASCAR Gander RV &amp; Outdoors Truck Series race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.</p><p>It was especially heartbreaking for Hill, a Georgia native, who had been so vocal about wanting to win at his home track. Late in Saturday&#8216;s race, he looked destined to hold the trophy &#8212; bettering the afternoon&#8216;s most dominant drivers, NASCAR Cup Series regulars Kyle Busch and another Georgia favorite Chase Elliott, in the waning laps. Hill led 36 laps on the afternoon, second only to Busch&#8216;s race-best 37 laps out front.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/results/racecenter/2020/nascar-gander-outdoors-truck-series/vet-tix-camping-world-200/stn/results/\">Race results</a></strong></p><p>Ironically, it was Elliott who caused the final caution with three laps remaining in regulation, spinning out while running third and making his way forward to challenge for the lead. During the caution period, the front-running trucks all pitted for fresh tires, and Hill returned to the track for the two-lap overtime test as the race leader &#8212; only to have Enfinger pull alongside and then make the pass in Turn 1 as the field came around for the last lap.</p><p>&#8220;It was definitely wild, that&#8216;s for sure,&#8221; said Enfinger, who started sixth on that final two-lap green flag run. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t lead too many laps, but we led the ones that counted.&#8221;</p><p>It marks the second victory of the season for Enfinger and his No. 98 ThorSport Racing Ford, which finished .215-seconds ahead of Hill and led seven laps. It marks the first win for a Ford truck ever at Atlanta and it was Enfinger&#8216;s first career victory at the track as well. With a triumph in the Daytona season opener, it also marks the first multi-win season of his career.</p><p>&#8220;Unbelievable Ford F-150 really on the short runs,&#8221; Enfinger said. &#8220;We didn&#8216;t have everything we needed to make a real run at those guys, Chase [Elliott] and Kyle [Busch] there for the long run, but I do think we were decent, but on the short run, I knew if it came right down to it and we could get a good restart we could make it happen. Fortunately we got a good restart.&#8221;</p><p>Rookie Christian Eckes tied his career-best series effort, finishing third. Todd Gilliland and rookie Zane Smith rounded out the top five. Ross Chastain, rookie Derek Kraus, former series champion Brett Moffitt, Ben Rhodes and Stewart Friesen rounded out the top 10.</p><p>As Enfinger celebrated his dramatic win in front of empty grandstands, Hill climbed out of his No. 16 Hattori Racing Enterprises Toyota and leaned over the driver&#8216;s side window, resting his head on the roof, obviously gutted by the outcome.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8216;m sure when I go back and watch the race I&#8217;m going to look at all the different things I could have done differently for that not to happen,&#8221; Hill said. “I saw the 98 was getting a run on me down the backstretch but we had been so good on the bottom all day at the line that I didn&#8216;t really want to give that up and he was able to get to my quarter on entry to three. &#8230; Maybe I could have protected the outside line more or made my truck just a little bit wider, but I just think when we go back to the drawing board, maybe I could have said something different to [crew chief] Scott [Zipadelli] and the guys to maybe have a little better truck on that short run.</p><p>&#8220;It was a good race, I wish it would have went green there at the end but it didn&#8216;t so we&#8217;ll have to take what we had and go on. All in all, it was a good points day for us,&#8221; said Hill, who retains the championship lead by 20 points over Smith. The defending regular-season champion Enfinger is now ranked fourth, 31 points behind Hill.</p><p>In a field featuring two vastly different levels of experience &#8212; the track&#8216;s all-time winningest driver Busch along with 14 other competitors making their debut on the Atlanta high banks &#8212; the veterans certainly demonstrated their expertise.</p><p>For much of the race, the more experienced drivers prevailed. Busch &#8212; a five-time winner at Atlanta in the truck series &#8212; and fellow NASCAR Cup Series driver Elliott dominated the top of the scoreboard in the early portion of the race, with Busch winning both Stage 1 and Stage 2. Chastain, a truck series championship contender a year ago, put himself into the mix during a long green-flag run in the final stage despite starting 27th in the field.</p><p>Among the NASCAR Gander RV &amp; Outdoors Series championship contenders, it was the kind of solid performance Enfinger and Hill needed, even racing against some of the NASCAR Cup Series&#8216; finest.</p><p>Hill spent the early race holding his own among the front-runners, consistent and steady and when the opportunity to take the lead arose during green flag pit stops, Hill was there. With a little help from some uncharacteristic issues for Busch and Elliott.</p><p>Busch, who had already established his truck the class of the field, made what would likely have been his last pit stop with 35 laps to go. Immediately after returning to the track, however, his No. 51 Toyota hit the wall as he tried to avoid a damaged truck driven by Jordan Anderson. Unfortunately for Busch, he got a speeding penalty on his green-flag pit stop and then another when he came in to repair that damage. It dropped him to 29th place with 25 laps to go &#8212; a full lap down. He ended up 22nd.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/video/franchise/truck-series-highlights/busch-hits-wall-in-gander-trucks-race-at-atlanta/\">Video: Kyle Busch scrapes wall at Atlanta</a></strong></p><p>Elliott, who tried to pit with Busch on that last set of green-flag stops, was unable to get slowed enough to make his entrance to pit road. He returned to the race back in the pack but had worked his way up to third place with 15 laps remaining ready to challenge Chastain and Hill before crashing with three laps to go. He finished 21st.</p><p>&#8220;They&#8216;re always tough to swallow when you know you know that you&#8216;re that good and end up second,&#8221; Hill said. &#8220;But that being my hometown, this is one of the race tracks I&#8217;ve wanted to win at since I was a little kid racing here when I was 8 years old racing on the frontstretch. It hurts and it&#8216;s really frustrating, but we&#8216;ll keep digging.</p><p>&#8220;We have that points lead and we&#8216;re hoping to keep it. I&#8216;m excited to go to Homestead [next weekend], maybe we can get a win there like we did last year and get locked into the playoffs.&#8221;</p><p>Defending series champion Matt Crafton suffered significant front-end damage on his ThorSport Racing No. 88 Ford as a bottling-up after the pit-road entrance led to a collision with John Hunter Nemechek&#8217;s No. 8 NEMCO Motorsports Ford during the Stage 1 break. Crafton recovered to finish 12th; Nemechek was 25th.</p><p>The series&#8217; next race is scheduled next Saturday, June 13 at Homestead-Miami Speedway.</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/06/06/gander-trucks-post-race-inspection-atlanta-motor-speedway/\">No. 13 truck disqualified at Atlanta</a></strong></p><p><em>Contributing: Staff reports</em></p>]]>",

I think sometimes it&#8217;s easy for us who don&#8217;t know, as a white man or a white person, in general, we don&#8217;t know these stories. We don&#8217;t all the time ask the right questions to become informed.&#8221;</p><p>Dillon also applauded Wallace for being willing to speak up during a difficult time for the nation.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just proud of him as a friend, knowing him his whole career, too, and I think we&#8217;re going to see great things come out of this generation of NASCAR of who is in the sport right now,&#8221; Dillon said. &#8220;Hopefully it sets the tone for who comes after us. And for all of us, that would be the most important thing that we do.&#8221;</p><p>Dillon has made a conscious effort to understand what he and the NASCAR community must do in order to assist in positive change, reaching out to fellow drivers and NASCAR executives to create an objective for sparking a movement.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/06/01/nascar-statement-current-civil-unrest/\">NASCAR statement on civil unrest</a></strong></p><p>He feels it&#8217;s going to take a collective effort from the entire industry for that to happen, but that now is the perfect opportunity to make those changes.</p><p>&#8220;I think it does take, as a group, saying that we don&#8217;t stand for it,&#8221; Dillon said. &#8220;And once we all know that we&#8217;re all on the same page as saying we don&#8217;t stand for it, we come together with a united voice saying that we don&#8217;t tolerate hate, racism, bigotry in our sport and that it&#8217;s not OK.</p><p>&#8220;… There are great conversations going on with the folks in our sport. &#8230; And I&#8216;m very proud of that. Our sport is doing a good job, but it also takes the individuals who aren&#8217;t afraid to step out and say this isn&#8217;t about me anymore.&#8221;</p><p>While the feedback has been mostly positive, Dillon acknowledged that not everyone will be comfortable with what he has to say. That&#8217;s not going to stop him from openly discussing an uncomfortable topic that matters to him, though.</p><p>For Dillon, the reward of working toward racial equality is worth taking a stand.</p><p>&#8220;For me, I can tell you about my heart on it and for me, I don&#8217;t care if I ever win a race or a championship in my life or lose every follower I have on Instagram, but when my children grow older and I take my last breath, I want it to be made sure that I was on the right side of what I felt is going on in history,&#8221; Dillon said. &#8220;And that means way more than acquiring fame and trophies and wins. Those things all fade away. But the impact you had on human beings in your life, the relationship lasts forever. So, that&#8217;s my heart behind this.</p><p>&#8220;… I just wanted to stop, in the middle of my career, and say &#8216;Hey, this is where I stand.&#8217; There is the taunting in your head of what if I lose this or what if something happens. But, I know at the end of the day, this is what I believe in and I&#8217;ll stand up for what I believe in.&#8221;</p>]]>",

					"Body Top": "<![CDATA[<p>The first Dash 4 Cash race is Saturday at Atlanta Motor Speedway with the EchoPark 250 (4:30 p.m. ET on FS1, PRN, SiriusXM NASCAR Radio). Four NASCAR Xfinity Series drivers will be battling it out among the rest the of the 37-car field for not only the overall EchoPark 250 win but an additional $100,000 if they finish the highest among the Dash 4 Cash-eligible contingent. Those competing in the race within a race are Chase Briscoe, Harrison Burton, Brandon Jones and Noah Gragson.</p><p>There are four Dash 4 Cash events total, bringing the prize money to $400,000 total.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/05/28/dash-4-cash-is-back-2020-dates-tracks-announced-for-xfinity-series/\">Keep up with Dash 4 Cash results</a></strong></p><p>&#8220;If people are able to sweep that, that&#8216;s like a brand new sponsor coming on board for nearly half a season,&#8221; Briscoe said on a Zoom teleconference Thursday. &#8220;It&#8216;s a huge deal to win one of them, but if you win four of them, it&#8216;ll literally change your entire program. So it&#8216;s a huge thing for us. I think everybody financially right now is struggling with everything going on with the COVID stuff, so for a team to be able to have that swing — from no new money coming in to potentially $400,000 — is a huge thing.”</p><p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic paused all of NASCAR&#8217;s national-series schedules earlier this season for more than two months. The sport returned racing in late May without fans in attendance and with safety precautions implemented at track. Atlanta will mark the Xfinity Series&#8217; fourth race back.</p><p>Drivers eligible for the Dash 4 Cash are determined by the results of the previous race. Briscoe, Burton, Jones and Gragson were the top-four full-time finishers (among drivers that have declared to be running for the Xfinity Series championship) last Monday at Bristol Motor Speedway. Whoever has the best finish of those four at Atlanta will win the $100,000 bonus and qualify for the next Dash 4 Cash event. The next three highest full-time finishers will join the winner in competing for the bonus at Miami. Talladega and a yet to be determined race will serve as the other races in the program.</p><p>&#8220;You&#8216;ve seen in years past guys be really aggressive to win the Dash 4 Cash,&#8221; Burton said on another Zoom teleconference Thursday. &#8220;It puts on great races. It reminds me of the old Cup (Series) races that were worth a million dollars to win. That always seemed like it put more pressure on everything, right? It was a playoff-like atmosphere. And that&#8216;s good. That&#8216;s a good little test for us. The guys that are in the Dash 4 Cash along with us are guys, I think, we have to beat to win the championship.&#8221;</p>]]>",

Atlanta Motor Speedway will play host to Sunday&#8217;s Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 (3 p.m. ET, FOX, PRN, SiriusXM NASCAR Radio), an event originally scheduled March 15 before the postponement.</p><p>As with other events held since NASCAR returned to action after the coronavirus outbreak, the 325-lap race will take place without fans in attendance, and only a limited amount of essential personnel will be permitted on the track&#8217;s grounds. It will mark the sixth Cup Series race in NASCAR&#8217;s return and the 10th race overall this season.</p><p>Here&#8216;s a primer with helpful information for the showdown on the first Sunday of June.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/followlive\">How to follow the races</a></strong><strong> | <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/weekend-schedule/weekend-schedule-for-atlanta-motor-speedway/\">Schedule for Atlanta</a><br /></strong></p><p><strong>TRACK DETAILS</strong></p><p>Atlanta Motor Speedway is a 1.54-mile oval that held its first NASCAR Cup Series event on July 31, 1960. Fireball Roberts was the winner of that day&#8217;s Dixie 300. The first race was originally scheduled for late 1959 but was not run because of inclement weather.</p><p>With a 2,332-foot frontstretch and an 1,800-foot backstretch, each quarter-mile turn is banked at 24 degrees. The asphalt surface is the third oldest on the circuit, last repaved in 1997. Dover International Speedway (1995) and Auto Club Speedway (1996) are older.</p><p>Sunday&#8217;s 500-miler will be the 113th race for NASCAR&#8217;s top division on the Georgia track.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/gallery/ten-historic-moments-at-atlanta/\">Memorable moments at Atlanta</a><br /></strong></p><p><strong>STAGE LENGTHS</strong></p><p>Stage 1 is set to end at Lap 105, Stage 2 at Lap 210, and the final stage is slated to conclude on Lap 325.</p><p><strong>STARTING LINEUP</strong></p><p>Sunday&#8217;s Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 will be held without practice and qualifying as NASCAR tries to limit exposure for on-site personnel to control the spread of coronavirus. The lineup will be determined by a random draw among groups in the team owner standings:</p><ul><li>Positions 1-12: Random draw from charter teams in those positions in owner points</li><li>Positions 13-24: Random draw from charter teams in those positions in owner points</li><li>Positions 25-36: Random draw from charter teams in those positions in owner points</li><li>Positions 37-40: Open teams in order of owners points</li></ul><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/results/racecenter/2020/nascar-cup-series/folds-of-honor-quiktrip-500/stn/entries\">NASCAR Cup Series entry list for Atlanta</a></strong></p><p>Pit-stall selection will be ordered based on finishing positions from the NASCAR Cup Series&#8217; previous race &#8212; last Sunday&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/results/racecenter/2020/nascar-cup-series/food-city-presents-the-supermarket-heroes-500/stn/race\">Food City presents the Supermarket Heroes 500</a> at Bristol Motor Speedway &#8212; followed by new entries in order of points.</p><p>For more information about starting-lineup procedures for national-series races scheduled without qualifying, <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/05/27/nascar-announces-starting-lineup-pit-stall-selection-procedures-through-talladega/\">click here</a>.</p><p><strong>RULES PACKAGE</strong></p><p>The NASCAR Cup Series will use its 2020 intermediate track package. Cars will feature a 550-horsepower tapered-spacer engine with aero ducts (an adjustment made after the 2019 race at Atlanta Motor Speedway), an eight- by 61-inch rear spoiler and a front splitter with a two-inch overhang.</p><p><strong>GOODYEAR TIRES</strong></p><p><b>Tires are critical: </b>The track surface at Atlanta Motor Speedway may be the most worn and hardest on tires for the NASCAR Cup Series. This leads to teams pitting short of their fuel window to take fresh tires or working tire management to their benefit. Some drivers race hard early, while other conserve their tires to make a later run. Teams will be allowed 13 sets of Goodyear Eagles. Atlanta is also where Goodyear runs its multi-zoned tread right-side tire, which debuted in NASCAR in 2013.</p><p>&#8220;Tires are always something teams and fans think about when NASCAR makes its annual stop at Atlanta Motor Speedway,&#8221; said Greg Stucker, Goodyear&#8216;s director of racing. &#8220;With the abrasive track surface, tires are an important part of the race. Tire management often comes into play as those drivers that are easier on their tires early in a run will profit from that later on. Teams will opt for four tires on every stop, even after just a handful of laps if the opportunity presents itself. That also draws in the team aspect of our sport as the pit crews will be very busy with 13 sets of tires for the race.&#8221;</p><p><b>New setup for all NASCAR teams: </b>All three NASCAR national series will run the same tire setup, and it&#8217;ll be the first time teams have run either of the two Goodyear tire codes. For the Xfinity Series and Cup Series, compared to what was run last year at Atlanta Motor Speedway, both of the left-side and right-side tires feature construction updates to align with other speedways run. For the Gander RV &amp; Outdoors Truck Series, the tire setup features the same construction updates but also a compound change on the left-side tire &#8212; more grip &#8212; compared to last year at Atlanta. The right-side tire is a multi-zone tread tire, with a two-inch inboard compound designed for heat resistance (Endurance Zone) and a 10-inch outboard compound to give more grip (Traction Zone). Like all other NASCAR ovals greater than a mile in length, teams will be required to run liners in all four tire positions. Air pressure in those inner liners should be 12-25 psi greater than that of the outer tire.</p><p><strong>STATS TO KNOW</strong></p><p>&#8212; Toyota has not won at Atlanta Motor Speedway since 2013. The manufacturer has made it to Victory Lane at every other active track besides Charlotte Motor Speedway&#8217;s Roval since then. Ford has won the last three Atlanta races.</p><p>&#8212; Kevin Harvick led the most laps in five consecutive races at Atlanta Motor Speedway from 2014-19, trying him with David Pearson for the longest streak at the Georgia track. The driver of the No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford won just one of those instances (2018). Harvick also has the most stage wins at Atlanta, with four tallies to his name.</p><p>&#8212; Bill Elliott is the only Georgia-born driver to win a race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, and he did so five times.</p><p>&#8212; Chase Elliott has the best average finish among active driver at Atlanta Motor Speedway. The driver of the No. 9 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet is averaging a 10.5 finish in four starts. Erik Jones has the next-best result, with a 10.67 average finish through three starts in his No. 20 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota. Everyone else is averaging a finish outside the top 10.</p><p>&#8212; Hendrick Motorsports has been dominant at Atlanta Motor Speedway. The Chevrolet-backed organization has the most wins (14), runner-ups (16), top-five finishes (59) and top-10 runs (90). Its 3,031 laps led is second most of all teams.</p><p>&#8212; Three drivers won the last five races at Atlanta Motor Speedway: Brad Keselowski (two), Jimmie Johnson (two) and Kevin Harvick (one). There have been nine different winners in the last nine races held at a 1.5-mile track.</p><p><em>Source: NASCAR statistics, Racing Insights</em><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>LIVE COVERAGE</strong></p><p>Tune in Sunday at 3 p.m. ET to television coverage from Atlanta Motor Speedway on FOX and the FOX Sports App. For full radio coverage, listen in to PRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio on-air.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/followlive\">Ways to follow the races</a></strong></p><p>For a more interactive experience, head over to NASCAR.com or the NASCAR app to check out an enhanced Race Center, live Lap-by-Lap coverage, the customizable live leaderboard with Scanner (which is FREE for both races), and the return of <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/drive\">Drive</a> (featuring in-car cameras).</p><p>Be sure to set your lineup in <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/fantasy\">Fantasy Live</a> and make your picks in the <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/finishline\">NASCAR Finish Line App.</a></p><p><strong>2019 RACE WINNER</strong></p><p>Brad Keselowski, who has already won two races in 2020, took his No. 2 Team Penske Ford to Victory Lane in last season&#8216;s trip to Atlanta Motor Speedway.

That said, if you are prioritizing the numbers since NASCAR&#8217;s return to racing then a compelling case could be made for Hamlin, who has two victories on the season &#8212; including one at Darlington last month. Bowyer&#8217;s recent Atlanta numbers make him a sneaky pick who is likely to be less popular among NASCAR Finish Line players, but as the numbers show, he carries a bit more risk with that selection. Surprisingly, the driver that sits second in points &#8212; Logano &#8212; is a middle-of-the-pack choice based on the numbers we are evaluating.</p><p>Make sure to get your picks for all the groups as well as the first- and second-place finishes in the NASCAR Finish Line App before Sunday&#8217;s race at Atlanta.</p>]]>",

					"Body Top": "<![CDATA[<p>NASCAR and Dover Motorsports Inc. announced Wednesday that Nashville Superspeedway will reopen to host a NASCAR Cup Series race in 2021.</p><p>The change will drop Dover International Speedway from two Cup Series races to one event next season. Dover Motorsports Inc. built the 1.33-mile concrete track in Lebanon, Tennessee, about a 40-minute drive from downtown Nashville.</p><p>&#8220;Thanks to the collaboration of Dover Motorsports and our broadcast partners, we are excited to bring NASCAR racing back to Nashville, a place where the passion for our sport runs deep,&#8221; NASCAR President Steve Phelps said in a release. &#8220;The Nashville market is a vital one for our sport, and bringing NASCAR Cup Series racing to Nashville Superspeedway will be an integral building block in helping us further deliver on our promise in creating a dynamic schedule for 2021.&#8221;</p><p><strong>RACING-REFERENCE: <a href=\"https://www.racing-reference.info/tracks/Nashville_Superspeedway\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Historic results</a></strong></p><p>Dates for the new Nashville event and Dover&#8217;s race weekend were not announced. Ben Kennedy, NASCAR vice president of racing development, said further announcements regarding the full 2021 schedule were still to be announced.</p><p>The move follows NASCAR&#8217;s recent rekindling of its relationship with the Music City, which played host to the NASCAR Awards banquet and Champion&#8217;s Week activities last December. Nashville Superspeedway hosted NASCAR, ARCA and IndyCar events during its operation from 2001-11, and the .596-mile Nashville Fairgrounds track was a fixture on the Cup Series schedule from 1958-84, with other NASCAR national tours running there until 2000.</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/gallery/nascar-history-in-music-city-nashville-tennessee/#photo-1\">NASCAR&#8217;s history in Nashville</a></strong></p><p>Since its last NASCAR event in 2011, the Nashville Superspeedway has sat idle except for occasional rentals for stock-car driving experiences or for car storage by Nissan, which has an assembly plant located in nearby Smyrna, Tennessee. Panattoni Development Company purchased a 147-acre portion of the 1,250-acre speedway grounds in 2018 with plans to redevelop the land for industrial use. The group exercised an option to buy an additional 132 acres last June. Neither land parcel included the track or its seating.</p><p>Denis McGlynn, president and COO of Dover Motorsports, said in a Wednesday afternoon teleconference the speedway is &#8220;in great shape&#8221; and the company planned to spend $8-10 million during the next two years to bring the 1.33-mile track back into operation. Those expenditures include refurbishing the track&#8217;s buildings, updating the infrastructure and replacing some SAFER barrier that was taken for use at the Dover track.</p><p>McGlynn said grandstand capacity at Nashville Superspeedway is 25,000, a figure that could double with the addition of temporary seating.</p><p>&#8220;I say that because maybe some of the things we want to do we won&#8217;t be able to get it done in one year,&#8221; McGlynn said of the two-year time frame for renovations. &#8220;We may have to stretch it out. In any case it&#8217;s very close to being ready. I think we&#8217;ll be up and running in first-class fashion come next June.&#8221;</p><p>The Fairgrounds board and Nashville city officials had been working on proposals to bring NASCAR racing back to the historic half-mile layout, with Bristol (Tenn.) Motor Speedway and parent company Speedway Motorsports, Inc., proposing a $60 million renovation plan and acting as go-betweens in negotiations. But disputes over how the property will be used for construction of a Major League Soccer stadium adjacent to the track have slowed progress on infrastructure plans and track improvements.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/gallery/active-nascar-drivers-to-win-at-nashville-superspeedway/\">Active NASCAR drivers to win at Nashville Superspeedway</a></strong></p><p>In a Wednesday morning statement, Marcus Smith &#8212; Speedway Motorsports&#8217; president and CEO &#8212; indicated the fairgrounds track remained a priority.</p><p>&#8220;The news that NASCAR will bring a Cup race to Wilson County and the greater Nashville region in 2021 is a positive move for the sport of NASCAR and for NASCAR fans,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;In recent years, we&#8217;ve made it very clear that we think Nashville is a place where NASCAR should be for the future and not just the past. Our efforts to work with state and local government officials to revive the historic Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway will continue. We believe that the beloved short track in downtown Nashville provides tremendous opportunity to be a catalyst for year-round tourism and entertainment development.&#8221;</p><p>Kennedy said the channels of communication remain open between NASCAR and SMI regarding the fairgrounds venue.</p><p>&#8220;Know they&#8217;ve certainly been very close to the project over the past few months,&#8221; Kennedy said. &#8220;It&#8217;s an important track for us on the ARCA side as well.  We&#8217;ll certainly stay in touch with them as things move along and continue to support them there.&#8221;</p><p>Dover International Speedway has hosted 100 Cup Series events since it opened in 1969, and the 1-mile Delaware track has had two annual dates on the premier series schedule since 1971.</p><p>&#8220;Our company is excited about the terrific opportunity to not only host a NASCAR Cup Series race weekend but opening our Nashville facility will enable us to host other exciting forms of racing and entertainment options,&#8221; said Mike Tatoian, executive vice president and chief operating officer for Dover Motorsports, Inc. &#8220;We are also proud that our long history with NASCAR will continue at the &#8216;Monster Mile&#8217; in 2021, and we also look forward to hosting the 9th Firefly Music Festival next summer.&#8221;</p><p>McGlynn said even though the COVID-19 outbreak had postponed its May NASCAR event, Dover may still hold two Cup Series races this year in a single weekend. A revised remainder of the 2020 NASCAR schedule has not been released, but Dover was originally set for a tripleheader weekend Aug. 21-23 with the Cup Series, Xfinity Series and ARCA Menard Series East at the &#8220;Monster Mile.&#8221;</p>]]>",

					"Body Top": "<![CDATA[<p>The overly simplistic view might be to say that Brad Keselowski somehow lucked into his two NASCAR Cup Series victories this year, that gift-wrapping was involved and that a doubly hexed Chase Elliott personally tied the bow. After all, the element of chance also smiled on Keselowski in both starting lineup draws this season, giving his No. 2 Ford the No. 1 spot each time.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to catch some of those breaks,&#8221; Keselowski admitted after his Sunday visit to Bristol Motor Speedway&#8217;s Victory Lane, but he noted that something still matters about being in contention, being in a proper position to pounce at opportunities when they unfold. It happened <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/05/24/brad-keselowski-wins-coca-cola-600-in-overtime/\">last weekend at Charlotte Motor Speedway</a>. It happened Sunday at Bristol Motor Speedway. It may happen when his status as NASCAR&#8217;s top free-agent prospect is finally resolved for 2021 and beyond.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/05/31/brad-keselowski-wins-second-race-of-season-at-bristol/\">Keselowski wins Bristol</a> | <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/standings/nascar-cup-series/\">Cup Series standings</a></strong></p><p>Opportunity might be the story of Keselowski&#8217;s season so far, as he adds to Team Penske&#8217;s series-leading victory tally with a right-place, right-time strut. Riding two wins in a three-race span have the 36-year-old veteran and new crew chief Jeremy Bullins building their case as early championship players, even as the questions persist about his future, about whether his hot streak will solidify his long-term place at Team Penske or boost his market value for a ride elsewhere.</p><p>Keselowski hears the questions, dutifully answers and insists he&#8217;s tuning it all out.</p><p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t put that much thought into anything other than competing and winning and wanting to be in a spot to compete and win for a long time,&#8221; Keselowski said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t let it be a distraction. I can&#8217;t always speak for others. The experience I&#8217;ve had with the team, they&#8217;re not either.&#8221;</p><p>Bullins, installed in the offseason as Keselowski&#8217;s new point man on the No. 2 team, has also heard the questions. He heard them again Sunday and said it&#8217;s something he and his driver have addressed. Even as uncertainty abounds, their mission remains fixed on staying the course.</p><p>&#8220;He and I have talked a lot about it,&#8221; Bullins said. &#8220;We both have said it&#8217;s not going to be a distraction to what we&#8217;re doing. If we keep having days like this, it won&#8217;t matter anyways.&#8221;</p><p>Days like Sunday were awfully similar to the previous Sunday, when Keselowski arose to lead the final five laps of the Coca-Cola 600. Elliott&#8217;s pre-overtime trip to pit road surrendered that perch to Keselowski for the final stretch, and the former champ didn&#8217;t buckle. Sunday at Bristol, Keselowski&#8217;s inheritance came from Elliott&#8217;s late-race clash with Penske&#8217;s Joey Logano, a shunt that handed him the lead for the final three laps.</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/05/31/cup-series-bristol-motor-speedway-joey-logano-chase-elliott/\">Chase Elliott, Joey Logano collide late at Bristol</a></strong></p><p>Part of what put Keselowski there wasn&#8217;t just his skill or the strength of his cars, but the team&#8217;s resilience, even when other drivers spent more time in front.</p><p>&#8220;I think that means everything,&#8221; Bullins said. &#8220;The fact that we <em>know</em> that we just have to keep Brad in the fight, keep him in position to where he can make something happen.  I think if we do that, if we can manage to do that throughout the day, he&#8217;s certainly not going to give up. I think our team has shown just how strong he can be when you put him in the right position. We&#8217;ve been able to do that a couple times.&#8221;</p><p>It has been eight years since Keselowski hoisted the Cup Series trophy for the first time, back when he drove a Penske-owned Dodge and when &#8220;Gangnam Style&#8221; became a thing. NASCAR&#8217;s playoff format and race structure have undergone two major changes in that time, and Keselowski has stacked 23 more Cup Series wins onto what has become a Hall of Fame-worthy resume.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/gallery/team-penske-wins-by-driver/\">Team Penske wins by driver</a> | <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/gallery/all-of-brad-keselowskis-monster-energy-nascar-cup-series-victories/\">All of Brad Keselowski&#8217;s Cup wins</a></strong></p><p>He has waited the better part of a decade to reprise his boozy celebration from an outsized pilsner glass on ESPN&#8217;s SportsCenter. Now in a contract year and with team chemistry growing, 2020 might present a prime opportunity for a second swig.</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all just really happy for each other&#8217;s success,&#8221; Keselowski said. &#8220;We&#8217;re there to pick each other up when things aren&#8217;t going our way and somebody is having a bad day. I think that&#8217;s what great teams do. This is turning into a great team. I&#8217;m super, super proud of them. I&#8217;m proud to be a part of it. I&#8217;m driving my butt off. Sometimes I think I might be driving a little bit too hard. So far it&#8217;s been paying off.&#8221;</p><p>The ultimate payoff may be long-term job security at Team Penske or a lucrative gig with another high-caliber organization.</p><p>Just don&#8217;t say he lucked into it.</p>]]>",

Allgaier charged out to a slight lead over Gragson as the laps dwindled, but a minor slip-up by Allgaier allowed Gragson to mount a final challenge.</p><p>That&#8216;s when the plot thickened, as Gragson powered to the bottom lane to push past Allgaier. The pair raced side by side for a half lap before Gragson&#8216;s No. 9 Chevrolet broke loose into Turn 1, sliding up to make contact with Allgaier&#8216;s No. 7 Chevrolet. Allgaier went up the 36-degree banking, hitting the outside wall before sliding back down and spinning hard into the inside fence on the backstretch.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/results/racecenter/2020/nascar-xfinity-series/cheddars-300-presented-by-alsco/stn/race/\">Official race results</a></strong></p><p>From Gragson&#8216;s perspective, it was an opportunity he couldn&#8216;t pass up despite the risk of upsetting a counterpart.</p><p>&#8220;(Allgaier) slipped up in 1 and 2 when I was running him down and that allowed me to get inside of him,&#8221; Gragson said. &#8220;I wouldn&#8216;t have gotten to him if he didn&#8216;t slip up. Got into him going into 1 and 2 and just got loose underneath him.</p><p>&#8220;I don&#8216;t make excuses. I take responsibility. I apologize for the 7 car, but I&#8216;m here to win races for the No. 9 team and they put in way too much effort for me to ride around and finish second.&#8221;</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/video/franchise/xfinity-series-victory-lane/gragson-after-bristol-win-thats-not-how-i-want-to-race/\">Noah Gragson apologizes to No. 7 team, Justin Allgaier</a></strong></p><p>While Gragson hung on for his second triumph of the 2020 season after an overtime restart, Allgaier was unable to finish the race despite leading a race-high 156 laps, placing 18th. The veteran JRM driver admitted to his mistake, but it didn&#8216;t change the fact he left the .533-mile Tennessee track frustrated.</p><p>&#8220;The team did a great job getting us track position we needed,&#8221; Allgaier told PRN after the incident. &#8220;I&#8216;m more mad at myself for making a mistake and getting off the bottom, but yeah, we got wrecked.&#8221;</p><p>Gragson passed by Allgaier after his victory celebration.</p><p>&#8220;I saw him and he said he would talk to me later,&#8221; Gragson said. &#8220;We are a family over at JR Motorsports and that&#8216;s not my goal is to tear up race cars, but I had the opportunity. The opportunity is there. The opportunity can slip away and I want to damn well take advantage of it.</p><p>&#8220;I don&#8216;t know what&#8216;s going to happen in the future. I take full responsibility for getting loose underneath him, that&#8216;s a fact. One thing you can&#8216;t say is I&#8216;m not aggressive and I&#8216;m not going to try. I&#8216;m sure he probably owes me one, but you don&#8216;t slip up the lap before and I don&#8216;t get to you and you drive off to victory. Don&#8216;t mess up, I guess.&#8221;</p><p>While Gragson showed some remorse for ending his teammate&#8216;s night early, he didn&#8216;t back down from his stance on leaving it all out on the track, noting he&#8217;d be unable to look his crew members in the eyes if he didn&#8216;t make the aggressive effort.</p><p>&#8220;I have a lot of respect for Justin and the No. 7 team,&#8221; Gragson said. &#8220;All of us drivers are on the limits and I don&#8216;t know if it&#8216;s a mistake or whatnot, but it ended bad for him unfortunately, but still a tremendous amount of respect for him. He&#8216;ll probably race me differently, but time will tell, that&#8216;s why everyone should keep watching.</p><p>&#8220;I don&#8216;t like wrecking people. I don&#8216;t like wrecking teammates, that&#8216;s not how I race. I&#8216;m an aggressive race-car driver, and when you&#8216;re battling for wins, I guess (expletive) happens. … I leave it all out on the track, and it is what it is.&#8221;</p>]]>",

I was of course a Davey fan being from Alabama, but someone handed me a Mark Martin poster and I hung it on my wall when I got home and pulled hard for him ever since. After that first race, I spent every Sunday afternoon when I could in my grandfather&#8217;s living room glued to the TV watching the race with him growing up.&#8221;<em></p><p></em><em><strong>Q. What is your favorite part about NASCAR?<br /></strong></em>&#8220;The speed, the history, and watching it evolve with time. The different personalities and paths drivers take to make it. Watching someone come into trucks and trying to predict where they will be in a few years. Watching drivers grow and become dominant or struggle to finally succeed. There is so much more to it than just &#8220;going in circles&#8221; as some say. The whole world of NASCAR is what I enjoy, not just the races.&#8221;</p><p><em><strong>Q. What is your favorite NASCAR memory?<br /></strong></em>&#8220;There are so many to choose, sitting in the orange recliner at my grandads growing up watching races, standing in a Walmart electronics center in the 90&#8217;s watching nearly a whole race while my family shopped. But my favorite is probably my most recent. Darlington was always on my bucket list of tracks and I finally got to go to a race there 2 years ago. Since Martin Truex Jr. started in the Busch Series, I had been pulling for him to make it. I have been to many races but never got to watch one of my favorite drivers win while there. So, seeing Martin pull off that win at one of my favorite tracks was one of the happiest times watching racing.&#8221;</p><p><em><strong>Q. Do you have a favorite in any of the following categories?<br /></strong></em><strong>Drivers: &#8220;</strong>Martin Truex Jr, Ryan Blaney, and Landon Cassill.&#8221;<br /><strong>Tracks: &#8220;</strong>Talladega, Darlington, Watkins Glen, Atlanta.&#8221;<br /><strong>Sponsors:</strong> &#8220;I don&#8217;t have one single favorite, but a few that pop into my head when I think NASCAR like STP, Bass Pro, and the old Valvoline and Havoline cars.&#8221;</p><p><em><strong>Q. What are some of your hobbies?<br /></strong></em>&#8220;Hunting and fishing when I am not at the softball fields watching my daughter.&#8221;</p><p><em>​<strong>FROM ALL OF US AT NASCAR</strong></em><em><strong>, WE THANK PAUL FOR HIS CONTINUED SUPPORT AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM HIM IN 2020!</strong></em></p><p><em>Look for Paul on the Official NASCAR Fan Council page on NASCAR.COM.</em></p>]]>",

					"Body Top": "<![CDATA[<p>Bristol Motor Speedway has long been built on atmosphere. The eggshell-anticipation that comes with the Colosseum theme of full-contact racing. The noise that echoes off the grandstands and surrounding hills, giving it the Thunder Valley nickname. The roar that erupts from the bleachers when tens of thousands react to the almost inevitable short-track drama.</p><p>The speedway &#8212; no dummies &#8212; markets that bottled-up emotion to the hilt. Sunday, with COVID-19 safety restrictions still in place, there was no admittance save for essential personnel. It didn&#8217;t stop a handful of hearty faithful from parking outside to soak in a whiff of it &#8212; sounds only and sights unseen.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/05/31/brad-keselowski-wins-second-race-of-season-at-bristol/\">Keselowski prevails</a> | <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/05/31/cup-series-bristol-motor-speedway-joey-logano-chase-elliott/\">Elliott, Logano clash</a></strong></p><p>Sunday&#8217;s Food City presents the Supermarket Heroes 500 brought back many familiar ingredients to the &#8220;It&#8217;s Bristol, Baby&#8221; formula that built the place. Never mind that the track was very nearly built in the nearby Piney Flats community, and that the slogan &#8220;It&#8217;s Piney Flats, Baby&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t have quite the same ring.</p><p>Digressions aside, shades of the Bristol that brought people clamoring for more emerged Sunday. Crumpled sheet metal and equally damaged egos were commonplace, and winner Brad Keselowski was one of the few who left the .533-mile bullring smiling.</p><p>It was dynamic, just far, far quieter.</p><p>&#8220;Early on in the race everybody was hitting each other. It carried in all the way to the end,&#8221; said Keselowski, who sprang up to lead the final three laps. &#8220;Some people ran me over. I probably ran some people over. Everybody is mad at everybody going into Atlanta next week.&#8221;</p><p>NASCAR&#8217;s five-race return since the pandemic outbreak has been heavy on drama and subplots. Besides the unique situation of racing under new public-health protocols, the addition of shorter midweek races has ramped up the urgency to gain ground wherever possible. Darlington&#8217;s second event erupted with a Chase Elliott vs. Kyle Busch confrontation, and Charlotte&#8217;s pair of races came loaded with heartbreak then redemption for NASCAR&#8217;s Most Popular Driver.</p><p>Bristol stood next as a likely candidate to add more pressure in the cooker. The track&#8217;s calling card was already close-quarters racing, but NASCAR&#8217;s reduced-downforce package for its shorter venues in 2020 meant a greater challenge. Holding the event without practice or qualifying produced more variables, and the addition of PJ1 traction compound to the lower lanes in the turns offered grooves, options and possibilities as the race&#8217;s complexion evolved.</p><p>As the daytime start progressed to evening, the cream rose and the specter of late-race contact among some of the sport&#8217;s heavyweights came through. Elliott was again at the center of that crescendo, with Joey Logano as his rival this time, and both of their cars cramming together into the Turn 3 wall with fewer than five laps remaining. They dismounted and argued, with reasonable social distance and through face masks, but oddly without any crowd buzz to stoke the confrontation. Piped-in cheers and jeers just wouldn&#8217;t have done the trick.</p><p>That&#8217;s where the long-range hopes come in. Bristol&#8217;s annual night race remains one of the best tickets on the Cup Series schedule, an event that mixes all of Sunday&#8217;s recipe essentials under the glare of bright lights. In a delicious wrinkle, those ingredients move this year from mid-August to a September date in the NASCAR Playoffs with elimination from the postseason picture in the balance. Same formula, higher stakes.</p><p>&#8220;More of the same. That&#8217;s Bristol, man,&#8221; said runner-up Clint Bowyer, who likened the place to I-70 Speedway in Missouri, a short track entrenched in his racing roots. &#8220;Just like this place. They called it the action track. When you pull in here, you know all hell&#8217;s going to break loose. You don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s coming from, where it&#8217;s going to be, how it&#8217;s going to be, who is going to be the benefactor, who is going to leave pissed off.</p><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s short‑track racing at its best. Nobody does it better than Bristol.&#8221;</p><p>It&#8217;s an atmosphere that the faithful fans parked outside Bristol Motor Speedway on Sunday can hopefully feel, hear and see when September arrives.</p>]]>",

Elliott and Keselowski&#8216;s teammate Joey Logano took up the fight for the lead and ultimately collided into the Turn 4 wall leaving a golden opportunity for Keselowski who led the field right by.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“It was just such a turn of events it felt like I was playing poker in Vegas,&#8221; Keselowski joked.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/05/31/cup-series-bristol-motor-speedway-joey-logano-chase-elliott/\">Joey Logano, Chase Elliott see victory chances end with late-race wreck</a></span></strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Logano, who ended up 21st and Elliott, who ended up 22nd, had an intense conversation on pit road after the race.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“As soon as I turned off the wall I had zero chance of making it, I&#8216;ll certainly take the blame, I just got loose,&#8221; Elliott said. “I really felt like that was my shot, he was really good on the short run and I felt like I had to keep him behind me right there in order to win the race, with only three or four laps to go. I hate we both wrecked.&#8221;</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Big picture perspective, however, Elliott, had yet another strong day winning the first two stages.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">His fast No. 9 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet won the most recent series race on Thursday at Charlotte and was runner-up to Keselowski in the 600 as well.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It was also a promising day for Kyle Busch, who had led only 14 laps this entire season coming to Bristol &#8211; where he is NASCAR&#8216;s all-time winningest driver with eight Cup, nine Xfinity and five Gander RV &amp; Outdoors Truck Series victories &#8212; but ultimately led 100 laps Sunday earning his fifth top-five finish of the season; third in the last four races.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He certainly turned in a great rally effort. After being penalized for speeding on pit road early and falling back as far as 31st, he methodically and expertly worked his way forward to lead laps and show his No. 18 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota a factor in the outcome.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ryan Blaney led 60 of the opening laps and was challenging his Team Penske teammate Keselowski for the race lead when he hit the wall on Lap 199 of the 500. As Blaney&#8216;s No. 12 Ford came down off the wall, Ty Dillon&#8216;s car &#8212; unsure where Blaney&#8216;s car was sliding &#8211; slammed into the front of it.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/05/31/bristol-motor-speedway-cup-series-ryan-blaney-ty-dillon-crash/\">Ryan Blaney, Ty Dillon exit after Stage 2 wreck at Bristol</a></span></strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Radiator damage spelled the end of Blaney&#8216;s otherwise promising day. But as he reassured his crew heading onto pit road, “at least we&#8216;ve got something to build off for the Playoff race here.&#8221;</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A larger accident, involving eight cars in various capacities ended Ricky Stenhouse Jr.&#8216;s day at his favorite track. Stenhouse ran among the top-10 for much of the early race and was among those frontrunners when he was caught up in a chain reaction accident.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While slowing for Matt Kenseth in front of him, Stenhouse was nudged from behind by Johnson. The contact sending Stenhouse hard into the wall and he collected a half dozen others including 2020 race winner Alex Bowman and impressive Sunoco Rookie of the Year candidates Tyler Reddick and Cole Custer ending their days.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In all, there were 17 caution periods for 102 laps on the day &#8211; the most in a Bristol race since 2006.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With an 11th-place finish, Stewart-Haas Racing&#8216;s Kevin Harvick continues to lead the NASCAR Cup Series championship standings by 24 points over Logano and 45 over Elliott.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The series moves to the 1.5-mile Atlanta Motor Speedway for next Sunday&#8216;s Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 (3 p.m. ET on FOX, PRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio) and then competes in another mid-week special at the smallest oval on the schedule, Martinsville (Va.) Speedway on Wednesday night, June 10.</span></p>]]>",

But the 26-year-old driver lost control while running second and his No. 12 Ford sustained heavy front-end damage in a collision with Ty Dillon&#8217;s No. 13 Germain Racing Chevrolet.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/05/31/stage-results-bristol-motor-speedway/\">Elliott tops Blaney for Stage 1 win</a></strong></p><p>&#8220;Take it to the truck. We knocked the radiator out of it,&#8221; the No. 12 crew told Blaney, who nursed the rumpled car back to the garage area. Both Blaney and Dillon were sidelined.</p><p>Blaney was the race&#8217;s first retiree and will be scored last in the 40-car field. Dillon managed to complete two additional laps before ending his day in 39th place.</p><p>&#8220;I was way high and that&#8216;s obviously not where I wanted to be, but I didn&#8216;t think I was that high getting in there. It might have just been trying to get too much and got in the marbles and spun out,&#8221; Blaney said of his initial trouble. &#8220;I thought we were gonna be OK and then we got destroyed about six seconds later, so that&#8216;s just Bristol and a part of Bristol. I probably shouldn&#8216;t have been pushing that hard, but trying to get back to the lead. I thought we found some speed up there, just a mistake on my part.</p><p>&#8220;After having two strong weeks, you go and you wreck not even halfway, so that&#8216;s just a bummer.

Things happen fast and just couldn&#8216;t get slowed up enough and turn and miss me. I think we&#8217;re both out of it, but I shouldn&#8216;t have been sitting there sideways on the track anyway. That stinks, but I thought we were gonna be OK and just can&#8216;t seem to avoid things here. It&#8216;s hard to do, but I hate it for everybody on our crew. We had a good car and I just kind of overstepped it and cost us.&#8221;</p>]]>",

As an undergrad at Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C. &#8212; which is about 60 miles from Thunder Valley &#8212; I attended the 2001 spring race at Bristol (won by Elliott Sadler), working a credit card booth for a fraternity fundraiser.</p><p>I walked into that racetrack knowing nothing about NASCAR and left with it instantly moving to the top of my list of favorite sports.</p><p>The NASCAR Cup Series returns to Bristol on Sunday for the Supermarket Heroes 500, a race that is sure to provide plenty of beating, banging, excitement and angry drivers.</p><p>Here&#8217;s how I&#8217;m navigating Sunday&#8217;s race from a NASCAR betting perspective.</p><h2><strong>NASCAR at Bristol Best Bet Picks</strong></h2><p><em>*Odds as of 7:30 a.m. ET on Sunday</em></p><p>As of Sunday morning, I&#8217;m still waffling on which favorite to bet, or to bet one at all.</p><p>Be sure to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PJWalsh24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">follow me on Twitter (@PJWalsh24)</a> and I&#8217;ll post all updated bets I make that aren&#8217;t listed below.</p><h3><strong>Ryan Blaney (+1400)</strong></h3><p>If you simply look at average finish, Blaney&#8217;s performances at Bristol are nothing to write home about, but it&#8217;s the underlying metrics that make him so appealing on Sunday.</p><p>Over the past four races at Bristol, his 14.0 average finish ranks just 11th among all drivers, yet Blaney has the second-best driver rating, has run the third-most fast laps and has led the most laps in the series.</p><p>This four-race sample is important because the race package they&#8217;ll use this weekend is closer to what was run in 2018 than last season, so it&#8217;s important to not solely look at last year&#8217;s results as the way the cars will drive on Sunday could be significantly different than 2019.</p><p>After finishing third at Charlotte on Wednesday, Blaney is also third in line picking his pit stall, which is huge at Bristol due to a very tricky pit road.</p><p><mark><a href=\"https://switchboard.actionnetwork.com/offers?bookId=76&amp;context=web-article-textlink-betnow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">[Bet now at PointsBet. NJ and IN only.]</a></mark></p><h3><strong>Kurt Busch (+1600)</strong></h3><p>Busch has six career wins at Bristol, including the 2018 night race, which was run with a race package very similar to what the Cup Series is using at short tracks this season.</p><p>Kurt also finished fifth on Wednesday at Charlotte, meaning he&#8217;ll have one of the best stalls on pit road.</p><p>History of success at Bristol? Check. Fast car this season? Check. Good pit stall? Check.</p><p>Sign me up at 16-1.</p><p><mark><a href=\"https://switchboard.actionnetwork.com/offers?bookId=68&amp;context=web-article-textlink-betnow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">[Bet now at DraftKings. CO, NJ, PA, IN and WV only.]</a></mark></p><h3><strong>Matt DiBenedetto (+2500)</strong></h3><p>I know, I just said we shouldn&#8217;t lean solely on last season&#8217;s results at Bristol due to an aero package change, but that&#8217;s trickier than meets the eye with DiBenedetto.</p><p>Matty D. moved from Go Fas Racing to Leavine-Family Racing prior to the start of the 2019 season, which was a significant upgrade in the quality of his equipment.</p><p>DiBenedetto now drives for Wood Brothers, which is solid equipment as well, so looking at his Bristol stats prior to 2019 doesn&#8217;t accurately reflect how good he is here &#8212; although he has consistently over-performed his equipment in Thunder Valley throughout his career.</p><p>Last season, only three drivers &#8212; Kyle Busch, Denny Hamlin and Kurt Busch &#8212; had a better average finish at Bristol than DiBenedetto. He also led the fifth-most laps en route to the ninth-best driver rating, indicating he was clearly a top-10 car over the course of both races.</p><p>Remember, betting is about the value in the number, and here we&#8217;re getting a driver who finished second the last time the Cup Series visited this track, knows how to lead laps and will start ninth at 25-1 odds.</p><p><mark><a href=\"https://switchboard.actionnetwork.com/offers?bookId=68&amp;context=web-article-textlink-betnow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">[Bet now at DraftKings. CO, NJ, PA, IN and WV only.]</a></mark></p><h3><strong>Tyler Reddick (+7000)</strong></h3><p>Well, may as well not stop betting him now!</p><p>Reddick has never run a Cup race at Bristol, but man was he fast there in the XFINITY Series.</p><p>Tyler had the best driver rating in the spring XFINITY race at Bristol last season en route to a second-place finish, and improved upon that in the fall by winning in incredibly impressive fashion.</p><p>After failing pre-race inspection, Reddick was forced to start last, then make a pass-through penalty lap as soon as the race started, which meant he had to come down pit road, under pit road speed, while the rest of the cars were racing on the track at full speed.</p><p>This put him almost two laps immediately to start the race. In response, all Reddick did was climb back onto the lead lap, then work his way through the entire field before eventually winning the race.</p><p>Reddick is just too good here to pass up at the longshot price of 70-1.</p><p><mark><a href=\"https://switchboard.actionnetwork.com/offers?bookId=69&amp;context=web-article-textlink-betnow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">[Bet now at FanDuel.

Tying Bowyer with the best average finish the past two races at Bristol, it&#8217;s his heartbreaking second-place finish in last year&#8217;s night race to Denny Hamlin that makes him a trendy pick for Sunday. Wood Brothers Racing always brings a good car to the half-mile Tennessee track and DiBenedetto knows how to wheel it around that place.</p><p>You could make a case for Jones with the speed he has showcased in the No. 20 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota at Darlington and Charlotte, but it&#8217;s risky given his lackluster performances at Bristol. Although Bowman has been fast all season, not sure he&#8217;s the best choice out of the bunch for Sunday.</p>]]>",

The cars will use a reduced downforce package with a shorter spoiler, a shorter splitter overhang and other aerodynamic changes.</p><p><strong>GOODYEAR TIRES</strong></p><p tabindex=\"0\"><strong>Bristol is not your average short track:</strong> There are three factors that stand out when it comes to racing at Bristol Motor Speedway. First, the banking creates more speed and load than the &#8220;flatter&#8221; Martinsville Speedway or Richmond Raceway. This makes Bristol race more like a speedway than a short track in some ways. Second, Bristol has a full concrete surface, which wears tires fairly aggressively when the track is &#8220;green&#8221; with no rubber built up on it. Goodyear designs its tread compounds for Bristol to take the right amount of rubber and not &#8220;cake up&#8221; on the surface, leaving cars with a good level of grip. Third is the fact that Goodyear, NASCAR and the track operations staff will work together to apply the PJ1 grip compound to the lower four feet of both sets of corners for this weekend&#8216;s races. While this does impact tire wear, its primary purpose is to give drivers a competitive, alternate lane late in the race after many cars work their way up the track and make the upper lane the fastest way around.</p><p tabindex=\"0\">&#8220;Bristol provides several unique challenges for both Goodyear and the race teams,&#8221; said Greg Stucker, Goodyear&#8216;s director of racing. &#8220;We have worked hard in recent years to refine the tread compounds that we bring there, as well as the other concrete tracks on the circuit. The key with concrete is to get it to take rubber, but just the right amount of rubber. It is easy to see that process once the race starts as the track turns from white to black, and lighten again as cars pick up some of that rubber when they are not at speed under cautions. Also, the tire constructions we bring to Bristol are more similar to what is run on speedways because of the speed in the high-banked corners and the level of load placed on the tires. You also have to consider that PJ1 comes into play at Bristol. While the track has progressive banking, adding the grip compound to the bottom lane in the corners gives the drivers a viable, second groove. Teams will likely stay down low early in the race, but as more cars move up top and work that third groove into the fastest lane, the bottom will remain comparable and be a place where drivers can go to make passes.&#8221;</p><p tabindex=\"0\"><strong>New right-side tire for Cup, Xfinity at Bristol:</strong> Teams in both the NASCAR Cup and Xfinity Series will run the same tire set-up at Bristol this week . . . these teams ran this same left-side tire code in both races at Bristol last year, but this is a brand new right-side tire code . . . compared to what Cup and Xfinity teams ran at Bristol in 2019, this right-side features a construction update that Goodyear has been rolling into most speedways . . . this is the only track at which these teams will run either of these two tire codes in 2020 . . . unlike on most NASCAR ovals 1 mile or less in length, on which teams generally do not run inner liners in their tires, teams are required to run liners in their right-side tires only at Bristol . . . air pressure in those inner liners should be 12-25 psi greater than that of the outer tire.</p><p><strong>STATS TO KNOW</strong></p><p>— Brothers Kyle and Kurt Busch have a firm grip on the top reaches of Bristol Motor Speedway&#8217;s win list among active drivers. Younger brother Kyle leads the way with eight Bristol wins, just ahead of Kurt&#8217;s six. Matt Kenseth, who recently rejoined the Cup Series full-time, is next on the list with four career wins at the Tennessee track. Darrell Waltrip&#8217;s 12 Bristol wins head the overall record book.</p><p>— Bristol Motor Speedway is known for full-contact racing, and the amount of caution periods typically backs that notion. The last 15 Cup Series races have each had at least eight yellow flags. Bristol races have hit 20 cautions on three occasions (1989, 1997, 2003). Only once in the track&#8217;s history has a Bristol race gone green from wire to wire: &#8220;Chargin&#8217; &#8221; Charlie Glotzbach was the winner of that caution-free event in July 1971, leading 411 of 500 laps to best runner-up Bobby Allison by a three-lap margin of victory in the Volunteer 500.</p><p>— Kevin Harvick kept his grip on the Cup Series points lead after a 10th-place result Thursday night at Charlotte Motor Speedway, but he also kept his streak of top-10 finishes to start the season intact. The Stewart-Haas Racing veteran is the only driver to claim top 10s in every race this year; his overall streak dating back to 2019 stretches to 13 straight top 10s. Harvick has also accumulated the most points of any driver in NASCAR&#8217;s four-race return since the pandemic outbreak. He has also led the most laps (391) this season.</p><p>— Martin Truex Jr. has won three of the Cup Series&#8217; last four races on short tracks, including a season sweep last year at Richmond Raceway and a postseason triumph at Martinsville Speedway. The lone defeat in that stretch: A 13th-place outcome in Bristol&#8217;s night race last August, when he pitted with a flat right-front tire in the final stage. Overall, Joe Gibbs Racing has won the Cup Series&#8217; last five short-track events &#8212; the three wins from Truex, plus one each from Kyle Busch and Denny Hamlin.</p><p>— Hendrick Motorsports&#8217; surge in speed this season has pushed the organization to the top of several statistical categories. Hendrick Motorsports has led the most laps of any team this season, pacing 692 laps in the eight races so far. It&#8217;s a significant edge over Team Penske (512) and Stewart-Haas Racing (478) in the early going. Hendrick drivers have also won eight of the 17 stages in 2020. HMS driver Alex Bowman leads the series with four stage wins, having amassed three of those during the most recent two events at Charlotte Motor Speedway.</p><p><em>Source: NASCAR statistics, Racing Insights</em><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>LIVE COVERAGE</strong></p><p>Tune in to television coverage from Bristol Motor Speedway on FS1 (Sunday, 3:30 p.m. ET) and the FOX Sports App. For full radio coverage, listen in to PRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio on-air.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/followlive\">Ways to follow the races</a></strong></p><p>For a more interactive experience, head over to NASCAR.com or the NASCAR app to check out an enhanced Race Center, live Lap-by-Lap coverage, the customizable live leaderboard with Scanner (which is FREE for both races), and the return of <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/drive\">Drive</a> (featuring in-car cameras).</p><p>Be sure to set your lineup in <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/fantasy\">Fantasy Live</a> and make your picks in the <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/finishline\">NASCAR Finish Line App</a>!</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/gallery/fantasy-fastlane-bristol-food-city-500-preview/#photo-1\">Fantasy advice</a></strong></p><p><strong>2019 RACE WINNER</strong></p><p>Kyle Busch drove away from a five-car crash on Lap 2, taking a dinged No. 18 Toyota to victory in the Food City 500.

It helped to ease not just his heart-wrenching runner-up finish as he pursued a signature win in Sunday&#8217;s 600, <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/05/20/kyle-busch-spins-chase-elliott-late-in-darlington-race-gesture/\">but also his crash from contention</a> after a midweek run-in with Kyle Busch at Darlington Raceway.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/results/racecenter/2020/nascar-cup-series/alsco-uniforms-500/stn/results/\">Race results</a> | <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/05/28/results-charlotte-motor-speedway-cup-series-alsco-uniforms-500-race-recap/\">Chase Elliott prevails at Charlotte</a></strong></p><p>So Thursday, after Elliott took command for the final 28 laps to the finish, a familiar feeling crept in &#8212; dread. Anything going awry by then would&#8217;ve probably been met by a familiar response &#8212; his overly memed one-finger salute, borrowed from Darlington.</p><p>&#8220;Honestly, it really just keeps you grounded, to be completely frank, especially after Sunday,&#8221; Elliott said after a rainy last two days at the 1.5-mile track. &#8220;You&#8217;re just kind of waiting on something to happen. It just kind of keeps you grounded, and the fact that it&#8217;s never over until it&#8217;s over, we&#8217;ve been reminded of that quite a lot, and that&#8217;s a lesson I&#8217;m never going to forget.&#8221;</p><p>Gustafson didn&#8217;t wilt either, even with Sunday&#8217;s hard lessons to soak in from his perch atop the No. 9 pit box. His call to stop for tires at the end of the sport&#8217;s longest race left his driver with an insurmountable gap to close, after many other front-runners opted to hold their positions on older tires for the final restart.</p><p>Gustafson said he took the loss hard, but that the post-race conversations with Elliott in the days that followed were encouraging, providing the reassurance that both driver and crew chief were &#8220;in lockstep&#8221; with their strategy.</p><p>&#8220;You know, I don&#8217;t base my self‑worth on other people&#8217;s opinions or if I&#8217;m doing a good job based on what other people say, but certainly I&#8217;m a human being, too, and when you get that many rocks thrown at you, it doesn&#8217;t feel great,&#8221; Gustafson said. &#8220;But yeah, it was a long couple days, but at the end of the day, you&#8217;ve just got to look past it and move on.&#8221;</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/gallery/chase-elliott-through-the-years/#photo-1\">Chase Elliott through the years</a> | <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/gallery/chase-elliott-cup-series-wins/#photo-2\">See every Cup win for Chase Elliott</a></strong></p><p>The chance to get over the heartache came sooner than usual with a Thursday event, washed out from its originally scheduled Wednesday date by rain, but part of NASCAR&#8217;s efforts to pack in make-up races after the coronavirus shutdown. A measured return of Elliott&#8217;s stride came Tuesday with his <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/05/26/results-gander-trucks-charlotte-motor-speedway-race-recap/\">first Gander Trucks victory in three years</a>, a triumph that <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/05/26/chase-elliott-bows-after-capturing-kyle-busch-bounty-at-charlotte/\">bested Busch to clinch a six-figure donation for charity</a>.</p><p>Thursday, Gustafson added his part to the cause, making the right adjustments on the final pit stop to make Elliott&#8217;s car take off at full sail. Elliott passed a fading Kevin Harvick to take the lead for the only time all night.</p><p>Elliott then kept the dread at bay for 28 more laps, and Gustafson avoided any more cast stones or second-guesses.</p><p>&#8220;I think you have to be a little bit hard‑headed to do this job, and you have to find a way to improve, and just you have to kind of shake it off,&#8221; Gustafson said. &#8220;Professional sports are super fickle, and one day you&#8217;re good and one day you&#8217;re terrible, and you just get used to that.&#8221;</p>]]>",
